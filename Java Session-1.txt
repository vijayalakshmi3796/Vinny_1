Java Coding Conventions:
-> For variable names, we will follow camel notation.
eg:-  int employId;
      double employsalary;

-> For classes,interfaces names : each word first letter must be an upper case.
eg:- class HelloWorld{   interface TrainTheStudents{
        }

For methods: must be a verb and follow camel notation.

eg:- void performOperation();
     void add();
     void printAllElements();

For final variables: all the letters must be in upper case.

eg:- final int MIN_PRIORITY=1;
     final int MAX_PRIORITY=10;

For packages: all the letters must be in lowercase.

eg:- package com.ksoft.demo;
     package java.lang;
     package java.util.stream;

Arrays:
-> An array is a variable and in which you can store N no.of elements of similar type and can be processed using any looping control statement.
->Arrays are used to deal with or process N no.of elements.
->Arrays are in-built objects in java.
->Arrays have properties and methods to perform certain operations on them.

Array Declaration:

Syntax: <datatype> <arrayname>[] = new<datatype>[size];

eg:-    int marksOfStudent[]= new int[6];

                     (or)
Syntax:  <datatype>[]arrayName;
            arrayName



Array Initialization:

eg:-   int scores[]=new int[4];

           scores[0]=100;
           scores[1]=200;
           scores[2]=300;
           scores[3]=400;

              (or)

           int scores[]={100,200,300,400};

array length:-
this field gives the length of the base array

7.Problem statement:
Develop an application to store N no.of cities into an array and find out the vowel count in each city.

8.Develop an application to store 6 sub student marks and find out the student passed or not.
if passed,find he is in first or second or third division.
    First - 80 to 100 percent
    second - 60 to 79 percent
    Third - 40 to 59 percent
    Failed - less than 40

9.a)There are some N no.of oil pots with some amountof oil in each pot.And you will fill each pot for five times with same amount of oil(say 4 ml or 8 ml) and remove 
a pot,if the amount of oil in a pot is equals to pouring amount.and if a poyt is removed,then shift other pots on left side.Finallyprint the pots available with amount 
of oil in them.
